## What is a README.md file ? <span style="color: green;"> <- Introduction / Overview / Keywords</span>

 A README is usually a text file often in Markdown with the <span style="color: red;"> .md </span> extension. You can use any text editor. I am using VScode :smile:

README.md files can be created on a text editor, Github, or the command line.

 The history of README files is not very clear but there is an assumption that it may have began with early Macintosh system software installed with a "Read Me" on the Startup Disk . . . says wiki :)
