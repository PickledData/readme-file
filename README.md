 A README is usually a text file made using the markup language Markdown, hence the extension <span style="color: red;"> .md </span>. You can use any text editor to create a README file, I used VScode :smile:

  The history of README files is not very clear but there is an assumption that it may have began with early Macintosh system software installed with a "Read Me" on the Startup Disk . . . says wiki :)

## Creating a README 
README.md files can be created through text editor, Github, or the command line.

    HTML tags can be mixed with Markdown syntax.
